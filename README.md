This project was created with Python and uses Tkinter and Blender libraries. 

##  :beginner: About
This is a crochet software that allows users to create a crochet pattern with a UI, adding rows and different types of stitches via various buttons. As the user creates this pattern, a 3D model will update to demonstrate what the pattern would look like when actually crocheted. When the user is done making the pattern, they can generate a written version of the pattern. This written pattern, when followed, will create a crochet piece that matches the 3D pattern. 

## :zap: Usage
This project can be used to streamline the process of creating crochet patterns.

You can add any number of stitches by using the "Add" button. You can configure the type and amount. This adds to your current row.

 You can create a new row by selecting the "New Row" button. Once you create a new row, any stitches that you add will be appended to this.
